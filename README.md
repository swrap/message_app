# message_app

This application connects the [message_server](https://github.com/swrap/message_server) in real-time to update the
front-end messages for a user. You can init this repository inside of Android Studio and create a build to install
on your phone for this to work.

It forwards text-messages and allows users to send message remotely from anywhere where their android phone is connected and the app is logged in. Currently it only supports sms/mms. It can show users pictures and their message, but does not offer sending anything besides text from the web ui.
